		<h1>What do we do?</h1>
		<p>
			We automate your tasks, so that you can happily forget it. We are currently working on using
			CI to update packages in Void Linux to reduce maintainer burden, and get the latest versions
			of essential packages such as glibc and coreutils. We also appreciate cats. 🐈
